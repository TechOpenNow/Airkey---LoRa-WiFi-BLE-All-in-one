# Airkey
AirKey is an open-source all-in-one wireless tool that combines BLE 5.0, Wi-Fi, and LoRa into a single, compact device. No more juggling multiple dongles or modules—AirKey gives you everything you need in one board. With USB and UART interface and ranges up to 500 m for BLE/Wi-Fi and 5 km for LoRa(support 868/915/433 Mhz), AirKey is built for every makers and IoT innovators. Plus, features like remote configuration and relay networking make it easy to scale your projects without extra hardware.

Whether you choose the USB Dongle, the RP2040 module, or the Raspberry Pi HAT, AirKey delivers seamless connectivity and flexibility across all your workflows.
